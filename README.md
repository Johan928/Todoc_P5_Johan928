### General Info
Welcome to the Todoc project. The app allows you to create tasks to accomplish, create a new task and assign it to a project name.You can delete a Task. You can also filter your tasks by date or name by using the menu on the top right corner.
<br>You can also update a Task !!! Long Click on a Task Title, and you can now modify your task name and/or the project it was assigned to.
<br><br>For testing, 3 tasks are already created when you launch the app for the first time. You can Regenerate those 3 tasks anytime by clicking 'Generate Tasks' in the menu.
